                <div class="warning-content">
                    <p><strong>Critical Notice for All Users:</strong></p>
                    <p>The artificial intelligence tools provided on this platform are intended solely as <strong>support instruments</strong> and must not be used as primary content generators. Students must understand and adhere to the following principles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Do NOT fully rely on AI-generated content.</strong> Artificial intelligence lacks personal context, individual experience, and authentic voice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do NOT copy and paste AI outputs directly.</strong> Employers and recruiters are trained to identify AI-generated materials and frequently reject applications that lack authenticity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Companies actively screen for AI-generated CVs and cover letters.</strong> Automated detection systems and human reviewers can identify generic, non-personalized content.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI is a support tool, not a replacement for personal effort.</strong> Use AI suggestions as inspiration and guidance, but all final content must reflect your unique qualifications, experiences, and professional voice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalization is mandatory.</strong> Every document, response, and communication must be thoroughly reviewed, edited, and customized to reflect your individual background and the specific opportunity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The University of Wismar emphasizes academic integrity and professional authenticity. Misuse of AI tools may result in missed opportunities and damage to your professional reputation.</p>
